# TVMaze Utils Refactoring (Archived)

## Overview

This document archives the completed refactoring plan for GitHub issue #64, which involved moving utility functions from `tvmazeModel.ts` to `tvMazeUtils.ts`.

## Completed Work

The following utility functions were successfully moved from `tvmazeModel.ts` to `tvMazeUtils.ts`:

1. `isWebScheduleItem` - Checks if an item is a web schedule item
2. `transformScheduleItem` - Transforms a single TVMaze schedule item to our domain model
3. `transformSchedule` - Transforms TVMaze API schedule data into our domain model

## Implementation Details

### Code Migration

- Functions were moved to `tvMazeUtils.ts` with their implementations preserved
- Necessary imports were added to `tvMazeUtils.ts`
- JSDoc comments were preserved
- The original `tvmazeModel.ts` file has been removed as part of the broader migration to Zod schemas

### Updates to References

- All imports across the codebase were updated to reference the new location
- Tests were updated to use the new import paths

### Testing and Validation

- All tests pass after the refactoring
- The behavior of the application remains unchanged

## Benefits

1. **Improved Code Organization**:
   - Clear separation between type definitions and utility functions
   - Better adherence to the project's architecture standards

2. **Enhanced Maintainability**:
   - Utility functions are now in a dedicated utility file
   - Easier to find and modify related functionality

3. **Cleaner Dependencies**:
   - More explicit import paths
   - Reduced coupling between type definitions and utility functions

## Related Work

This refactoring was part of a broader effort to improve the codebase's structure and type safety, which included:

- Migration to Zod schemas for validation and type safety (Issue #56)
- Removal of deprecated type files (Issue #56)
- Future work to refactor type transformations to use Zod transform capabilities (Issue #66)

## Conclusion

The refactoring was successfully completed, meeting all the success criteria outlined in the original plan. The codebase now better adheres to the project's architecture standards for separation of concerns.
